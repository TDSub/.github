# Decentralized Subscription Protocol
Welcome to the Decentralized Subscription Protocol project! This protocol is designed as a revolutionary solution for subscription-based services, offering a decentralized approach that ensures anonymity, security, and ease of use. With a focus on overcoming the limitations of traditional payment systems, the protocol offers a trustless environment where both service providers and subscribers can engage in transactions with confidence.

Whether you are a developer, a subscriber, or an application owner, this documentation will guide you through the features, architecture, and contribution guidelines of the Decentralized Subscription Protocol. Please read on to explore how the protocol enables a seamless subscription experience while upholding the principles of decentralization.
## Documentation

### Overview and Objectives
The protocol aims to provide an efficient, decentralized subscription system that addresses the drawbacks of conventional payment systems, such as identification requirements, compliance with varied app rules, and the risk of payment channels being closed by a central authority. The protocol facilitates anonymous, decentralized subscriptions, assuring apps and users of seamless transactions through smart contracts.

#### Objectives:
- Implement a straightforward protocol for decentralized subscription services.
- Enable anonymous transactions for both apps and users.
- Guarantee secure subscription purchases and renewals through smart contracts.
- Initially focus on supporting Telegram mini-apps with plans for broader application.

### System Architecture
The system consists of three integrated projects:

1. **Smart Contracts:** 
   - *Subscription Contract:* Manages an individual subscription, allowing for renewal, rating, and red flagging (active subscriptions only).
   - *Subscription Collection Contract:* Represents an app and its subscription collections, storing user Telegram IDs, minting subscriptions, collecting ratings and red flags, processing subscription payments, allowing withdrawals, and defining subscription plans. This contract is frozen if over 30% of active subscriptions send a red flag, disabling its mint and withdraw functions.
   - *Protocol App Collection Contract:* Mints subscription collection contracts, collects protocol fees, and has functions to release or block frozen apps.
2. **Frontend:**
   - *App Owner Interface:* A web page and Telegram app (tapp) allowing app owners to define subscription collections, initiate mint transactions, and manage contracts for withdrawals and plan adjustments.
   - *Subscriber Interface:* A web page and tapp for users to mint subscriptions, leave ratings, send red flag requests, and renew subscriptions. 
   - *Integration Library/Widget:* Helps facilitate easier user and app owner interactions with the protocol.
3. **Backend:** The backend stores data for apps and users to simplify contract location and management.

### User Roles and Responsibilities
There are two primary user types:
1. **App Users (Subscribers):** Individuals who purchase and use app subscriptions.
2. **App Owners:** Entities that own and manage the apps and their subscription plans.

#### Responsibilities:
- **App Users:**
  - Purchase and renew subscriptions.
  - Rate and red flag subscriptions as necessary.
- **App Owners:**
  - Define and manage subscription collections and plans.
  - Initiate mint transactions.
  - Manage contract withdrawals and plan adjustments.

### Subscription Workflow
The subscription process begins with each app creating its unique Subscription Collection Contract through the protocol. This contract serves as the foundation for user subscriptions, allowing individuals to mint their subscriptions based on the plans defined by the app. The entire workflow is streamlined and user-friendly, accessible through various platforms including our dedicated Telegram app (tapp), official webpage, or the conveniently designed widget. This multi-platform approach ensures a smooth and intuitive experience for users while providing flexibility for app owners in managing subscription plans and user interactions.

### Security Measures
Thanks to the protocol's decentralized nature, both users and apps can trust that their funds are secure. The system is designed to be trustless, with only one centralized decision-making point: determining whether a frozen app should be freed or blocked. This decision is based on our reputation system and fee channel, ensuring the best possible outcomes for all parties involved.

### Mission
Implement a simple, anonymous, and secure protocol to facilitate decentralized subscription services for apps, starting with Telegram mini-apps, ensuring reliable transactions for both app owners and users.
